# **Farnia Nafarifard**
#### Welcome to my CSE110 User Page! My name is Farnia, I am a 3rd year undergrad student studying computer engineering at UC San Diego. Click [here](#background) to read more about me. Or take a look at the [README file](README.md) of my lab 1.

## Background
---
I actually started college as an electrical engineering major. It was through my first Electrica]l and Computer Engineering (ECE) course that I was introduced to embedded systems. And out of that experience, I fell in love with the process of programming and thinking of its logic to write code. 
Here is the first program I wrote in the C language:
```c
// Create a function named ArrayAverage that passes in an array of 10 integers and returns the average of the array (use a double for the result)

double ArrayAverage(int Numbers[]){
    double sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        sum = sum + Numbers[i];
    }
    return sum/10;
}
```
Starting the second quarter of my freshman year, I shifted gears and started taking computer science courses. In the past two years, I have worked on many projects, have worked as a part-time computer science tutor, and have applied my knowledge to do research in the field of autonomous robotics.

My favorite courses at UC San Diego so far:
- CSE 21. Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems
- CSE 100. Advanced Data Structures
- ECE 5. Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering
- ECE 109. Engineering Probability and Statistics
- HINE 118. The Middle East in the Twentieth Century

## Fun Stuff

If I find free time, I'd love to spend it on good movies, books, and bike riding! 
#### I. Movies
This past summer I put in a lot of effort into watching so many great movies. Here are some of the movies I **absolutely recommend** anyone to watch at least once:
- Chinatown
- Three Colors Triology: Blue, White, Red 
- The Shining
- Phantom Thread
- La Collectionneuse
- Schindler's List
- Cleo From 5 to 7
- The Silence of the Lambs

Do let me know what you think if you watch any of these!

And, I'm super excited and cannot wait to watch *No Time to Die* and *Dune* that are coming out in October. 
*No Time to Die* is the last mvoie where Daniel Craig plays the role of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Checkout [this official link](https://www.007.com/) to get started if you've never watched or heard of James Bond Movies. 
Lastly, *Dune* is the first of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, which is a story..
> set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "the spice," a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is thus a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.

With  Denis Villeneuve as the director and Timoth√©e Chalamet as the lead actor, the movie is expected to be a huge success in America. If this is your first time reading about *Dune*, go to the library or a near bookstore to get and start reading the book before it comes out in theatres on October 22 !!!!
